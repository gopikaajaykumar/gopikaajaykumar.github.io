I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the <a href ="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>. I am a member of the <a href="http://intuitivecomputing.jhu.edu/">Intuitive Computing Laboratory</a>, which is affiliated with the <a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/">Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare</a> and the <a href="https://lcsr.jhu.edu/">Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics</a>, and I am advised by <a href ="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cmhuang/">Dr. Chien-Ming Huang</a>. My research has been supported by the Howard and Jacqueline Chertkof Endowed Fellowship and is currently supported by the 2018 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program fellowship and the Inaugural Joint Nursing/Engineering Fellowship. I am interested in human-robot interaction and end-user robot programming.
