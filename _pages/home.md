I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the <a href ="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://intuitivecomputing.github.io/">Intuitive Computing Laboratory</a>, which is affiliated with the <a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/">Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare</a> and the <a href="https://lcsr.jhu.edu/">Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics</a>, and I am advised by <a href ="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cmhuang/">Dr. Chien-Ming Huang</a>. 

My research has been supported by the Howard and Jacqueline Chertkof Endowed Fellowship, Inaugural Joint Nursing/Engineering Fellowship, and the 2018 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program fellowship. 

My work aims to make it easier and more effective for users without extensive technical training to program collaborative robots. I am especially interested in designing and studying end-user robot programming methods in home settings.
