I am currently a research engineer in the Robotics Department at the <a href="https://robotics.swri.org/">Southwest Research Institute</a>. 

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. thesis, <a href ="https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/69511">Supporting End-Users in Programming Robot Motions</a>, in the <a href ="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, where I was advised by Dr. Chien-Ming Huang. 

My CV may be viewed  [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/Gopika_CV.pdf).
