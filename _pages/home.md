I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the <a href ="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>. I am a member of the <a href="http://intuitivecomputing.jhu.edu/">Intuitive Computing Laboratory</a>, which is affiliated with the <a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/">Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare</a> and the <a href="https://lcsr.jhu.edu/">Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics</a>, and I am advised by <a href ="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cmhuang/">Dr. Chien-Ming Huang</a>. 

My research has been supported by the Howard and Jacqueline Chertkof Endowed Fellowship, Inaugural Joint Nursing/Engineering Fellowship, and the 2018 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program fellowship. 

My research interests are in human-robot interaction and end-user robot programming, with a focus on just-in-time assistance and data-driven tools for facilitating easy robot programming for all.
